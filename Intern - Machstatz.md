ðŸ‘¤ **Role:** Intern

## Projects:

### Predictive Analytics of Rotary equipment failure

#### **â—‰ Project Overview**

This project aimed at **predicting potential failures in rotary equipment** using **triple-axis accelerometer sensor data**. By analyzing historical vibration patterns, the system was able to **detect anomalies and predict failure probabilities up to 2 weeks in advance**, enabling timely preventive maintenance and reducing costly downtime. Leveraged algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA

#### **â—‰ Tools Used** 

Python, Pandas, NumPy, PySpark, Kafka, SciKit Learn, Keras, SciPy, GitHub

#### **â—‰ Responsibilities**

* **Sensor Data Processing**: Collected and preprocessed **vibration signals** from triple-axis accelerometers, including noise filtering, resampling, and feature extraction.
* **Feature Engineering**: Extracted **time-domain features** (RMS, skewness, kurtosis), **frequency-domain features** (FFT-based spectral analysis), and **wavelet transforms** for transient detection.
* **Model Development**: Applied **machine learning and deep learning models** for failure prediction and anomaly detection.
* **Pipeline Automation**: Designed an **end-to-end workflow** for continuous ingestion, training, and inference using *Python, PySpark, and Scikit-learn*.
* **Alerting & Visualization**: Built dashboards and alert systems to notify maintenance teams of **early warning signals**.

#### **â—‰ Key Achievements**

* Predicted **rotary equipment failures up to 14 days in advance**, reducing unplanned downtime significantly.
* Improved **failure classification accuracy** by leveraging **ensemble learning models**.
* Enabled **real-time monitoring** with dashboards integrating predictions and health scores.
* Provided **actionable insights** that helped optimize **maintenance scheduling** and reduced operational costs.

#### **â—‰ Challenges**

* Handling **high-frequency sensor data** and ensuring scalable data storage and processing.
* Differentiating between **false positives** (benign anomalies) and actual early warning failure signals.
* Feature extraction from **non-stationary vibration signals** requiring advanced signal processing.
* Ensuring **model generalization** across different rotary equipment types.
