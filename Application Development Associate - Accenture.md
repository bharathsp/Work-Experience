## Projects:

### **Automation Marketplace**

#### ðŸ“… **Date:** 06 Nov 2020 - 01 Dec 2021

#### **â—‰ Project Overview**

This was an **internal project** to build a website called **Automation Marketplace**, designed as a one-stop platform where clients could **purchase bundles of cloud packages** for a set time period at discounted prices.

The website featured multiple interactive screens, including:

* **Explore Page** â€“ browse available cloud bundles
* **Add to Cart** â€“ select and bundle cloud packages
* **Place Order** â€“ confirm purchase details
* **Payment Page** â€“ process transactions securely

The platform aimed to simplify client access to cloud offerings while streamlining order management and package bundling.

#### **â—‰ Tools Used** 

Azure DevOps Repos, Azure Devops Boards, Azure Pipelines, Azure Reporting, Azure Artifacts, C#, Angular, JavaScript, NodeJS, Visual Studio Code, Git

#### **â—‰ Responsibilities**

* **CI/CD Pipeline Development**: Designed and implemented **CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps**, creating **Dev, Staging, Testing, and Prod** environments.
* **Branching Strategy**: Managed Git workflows with **Dev as the working branch**, implementing pull requests, code reviews, and manager approvals for downstream merges.
* **Frontend Development**: Contributed to the **Angular-based front end** and integrated with backend services using **C#**.
* **Version Control**: Regularly pushed and merged code via **Git**, ensuring smooth collaboration and deployment.

#### **â—‰ Key Achievements**

* Built a **robust CI/CD pipeline** that streamlined deployments across multiple environments, reducing manual release effort.
* Ensured **code quality and governance** by implementing pull request approvals and validation before merging to production.
* Contributed to a **seamless user experience** by developing core features of the **Explore, Cart, and Order Placement** screens.
* Strengthened collaboration between developers, testers, and managers through a structured branching and release workflow.

#### **â—‰ Challenges**

* **Pipeline Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple stages (Dev â†’ Staging â†’ Testing â†’ Prod) while minimizing downtime.
* **Code Review Delays**: Dependency on manager approvals sometimes slowed down merges, requiring effective communication.
* **Frontend Integration**: Ensuring smooth interaction between **Angular UI** and **C# backend** across different modules.
* **Version Conflicts**: Frequent merges in Dev led to occasional Git conflicts that had to be resolved carefully to avoid overwriting changes.
